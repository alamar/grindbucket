grindbucket MVP:

- Store tsv
- Store header: fields information, created/modified, comment.
- Header replication
- gzipped
- Chunked
- Basic operations: store, cat, list
- Basic manipulations: sort by field, select by field value
- 8-bit clean

Next steps:

- fix for different chunk size, field order
- join sorted buckets
- Niceties: sample
- More metadata, store history
- UTF-8 aware

Once we have interpretation:
- query
- map
- zip-with & group-by
